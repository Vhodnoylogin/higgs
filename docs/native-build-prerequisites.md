# Native build and binding verification

Updated 2 November 2026. The complete native plugin now compiles and links with MSVC v145, the public SKSE VR2.00.12 source and compatible Havok2010.2.0-r1 declarations. This supersedes the earlier missing-header blocker. Source/core checks, native linking, PE metadata checks and actual Skyrim qualification remain different results. The current [implementation ledger](https://github.com/Vhodnoylogin/body-pouches/blob/main/docs/trinity-synergy/implementation-status.md) records the delivered checkpoint.

## External inputs

Supply the SKSE source root containing `common/` and `sksevr/`, a compatible Havok `Source/` tree and an external output directory. No game folder or installation step is required. The header dependency inspected for this build is the2010.2.0-r1 tree in [Nemesis at52543894](https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main/tree/52543894f060375151bd40012d55821b38b81bfc/external/hkxcmd/havok_2010_2_0/Source). It remains an external dependency with its own notices; none of those headers or libraries is distributed in this repository. The tooling does not download dependencies or grant a new licence to them.

[`build_sdk_support.py`](../tools/build_sdk_support.py) compiles the actual SKSE support sources into three x64 static-CRT libraries:14common units,4SKSE-common units and144runtime units. Its manifest records source hashes, commands, failures and resulting library hashes. The build does not invoke the SDK projects' deployment hooks or modify the original SDK.

```powershell
python tools/build_sdk_support.py --sdk-root <SKSE-source-root> --output <external-support-output>

python tools/build_native.py --sdk-root <SKSE-source-root> --havok-root <Havok-Source-root> --support-library <external-support-output>/sksevr_1_4_15.lib --support-library <external-support-output>/skse64_common.lib --support-library <external-support-output>/common_vc14.lib --output <external-plugin-output>

python tools/verify_native_bindings.py --native-build <external-plugin-output> --image <SkyrimVR.exe>
```

The first two commands use Python's standard library and an x64 MSVC installation. The separate metadata verifier requires `pefile`. Build outputs, dependency staging and manifests stay outside the source checkout. `--compile-only` is available for diagnosis; it does not establish a linked native DLL.

## Compatibility boundary

[`build_native.py`](../tools/build_native.py) reads the existing native project's source list instead of compiling a portable fixture in its place. It bypasses project references, author-specific library paths and post-build copy commands. The generated external SDK overlays expose the fields the existing reverse-engineered sources inspect, route the SDK's inline memory-router and heap accessors to the game's existing wrappers, and retain the explicit eight-field convex-build configuration as a plain aggregate. The overlays preserve data layout and virtual slots; before/after hashes are recorded. They are development declarations, not a second physics engine.

[`sdk_bindings.cpp`](../src/RE/sdk_bindings.cpp) supplies the missing SDK link boundary. Engine operations delegate to the game: reference ownership uses the existing add/remove bindings; rigid-body configuration uses the existing constructor binding; four base virtual implementations use the verified table targets below. SDK DLL-local TLS and allocator globals do not substitute for Skyrim's memory owners. Colour packing and SIMD numerical constants are pure local values.

| Binding | VR1.4.15 RVA | Static evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| `hkReferencedObject::getClassType` | `0xA01800` | `hkReferencedObject` vtable at`0x15DA7B8`, slot1 |
| `hkReferencedObject::calcContentStatistics` | `0xA01810` | Same table, slot2 |
| `hkpConstraintData::getSolverResults` | `0xACC460` | `hkpConstraintData` vtable at`0x17ADF48`, slot13 |
| `hkpConstraintData::addInstance` | `0xACC470` | Same table, slot14 |
| Rigid-body configuration construction | `0xAC5FE0` | Existing upstream typed relocation retained |
| Container heap and per-thread memory router | Existing upstream bindings | Existing game allocator and TLS lookup reused |

The verifier compares those four table entries in the selected image and checks executable target sections. A small standalone executable runs the actual SDK numerical code and compares all576bytes of enum-ordered constants with the game's read-only table at`0x177CF50`. It also checks colour packing, value-returning min/max compatibility and native DLL machine/entry-point metadata. It neither loads the plugin DLL nor executes Skyrim. The encrypted on-disk text does not establish instruction-level signatures; the evidence is table/layout/compiler evidence, with game behavior still unqualified.

## CommonLib preparation

The [canonical migration assessment and inventory](https://github.com/Vhodnoylogin/body-pouches/blob/main/docs/trinity-synergy/commonlib-assessment.md) separate existing CommonLib wrapper candidates, metadata-only matches and operations needing further audit or an extension. These temporary legacy-SDK bindings are candidates for that later library boundary. No CommonLib source or Address Library entry is changed by this build work. Provider generations, input authority and transaction policy remain with HIGGS.
